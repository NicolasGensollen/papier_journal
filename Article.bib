abstract = {We consider three distinct and well studied problems concerning network structure: community detection by modularity maximization, community detection by statistical inference, and normalized-cut graph partitioning. Each of these problems can be tackled using spectral algorithms that make use of the eigenvectors of matrix representations of the network. We show that with certain choices of the free parameters appearing in these spectral algorithms the algorithms for all three problems are, in fact, identical, and hence that, at least within the spectral approximations used here, there is no difference between the modularity- and inference-based community detection methods, or between either and graph partitioning.},

abstract = {Many methods have been proposed for community detection in networks. Some of the most promising are methods based on statistical inference, which rest on solid mathematical foundations and return excellent results in practice. In this paper we show that two of the most widely used inference methods can be mapped directly onto versions of the standard minimum-cut graph partitioning problem, which allows us to apply any of the many well-understood partitioning algorithms to the solution of community detection problems. We illustrate the approach by adapting the Laplacian spectral partitioning method to perform community inference, testing the resulting algorithm on a range of examples, including computer-generated and real-world networks. Both the quality of the results and the running time rival the best previous methods.},

abstract ={Many networks of interest in the sciences, including social networks, computer networks, and metabolic and regulatory networks, are found to divide naturally into communities or modules. The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},
