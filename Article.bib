@article{Schank2001,
abstract = {In the past, the fundamental graph problem of triangle counting and listing has been studied intensively from a theoretical point of view. Recently, triangle counting has also become a widely used tool in network analysis. Due to the very large size of networks like the Internet, WWW or social networks, the efficiency of algorithms for triangle counting and listing is an important issue. The main intention of this work is to evaluate the practicability of triangle counting and listing in very large graphs with various degree distributions. We give a surprisingly simple enhancement of a well known algorithm that performs best, and makes triangle listing and counting in huge networks feasible. This paper is a condensed presentation of [SW05].},

@article{Nguyen2013,
abstract = {The increasing incorporation of renewable energy sources and the emergence of new forms and patterns of electricity consumption are contributing to the upsurge in the complexity of power grids. A bottom-up-agent-based approach is able to handle the new environment, such that the system reliability can be maintained and costs reduced. However, this approach leads to possible conflicting interests between maintaining secure grid operation and the market requirements. This paper proposes a strategy to solve the conflicting interests in order to achieve overall optimal performance in the electricity supply system. The method is based on a cooperative game theory to optimally allocate resources from all (local) actors, i.e., network operators, active producers, and consumers. Via this approach, agent-based functions, for facilitating both network services and energy markets, can be integrated and coordinated. Simulations are performed to verify the proposed concept on a medium voltage 30-bus test network. Results show the effectiveness of the approach in optimally harmonizing functions of power routing and matching.},

@article{Anvari2015,
abstract = {The power from wind and solar exhibits a nonlinear flickering variability, which typically occurs at time scales of a few seconds. We show that high-frequency monitoring of such renewable powers enables us to detect a transition, controlled by the field size, where the output power qualitatively changes its behaviour from a flickering type to a diffusive stochastic behaviour. We find that the intermittency and strong non-Gaussian behavior in cumulative power of the total field, even for a country-wide installation still survives for both renewable sources. To overcome the short time intermittency, we introduce a time-delayed feedback method for power output of wind farm and solar field that can change further the underlying stochastic process and suppress their strong non- gaussian fluctuations.},

@article{Zhang2013,
abstract = {Due to its reduced communication overhead and robustness to failures, distributed energy management is of paramount importance in smart grids, especially in microgrids, which feature distributed generation (DG) and distributed storage (DS). Distributed economic dispatch for a microgrid with high renewable energy penetration and demand-side management operating in grid-connected mode is considered in this paper. To address the intrinsically stochastic availability of renewable energy sources (RES), a novel power scheduling approach is introduced. The approach involves the actual renewable energy as well as the energy traded with the main grid, so that the supply-demand balance is maintained. The optimal scheduling strategy minimizes the microgrid net cost, which includes DG and DS costs, utility of dispatchable loads, and worst-case transaction cost stemming from the uncertainty in RES. Leveraging the dual decomposition, the optimization problem formulated is solved in a distributed fashion by the local controllers of DG, DS, and dispatchable loads. Numerical results are reported to corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.},

@article{Lydia2014,
abstract = {The wind turbine power curve shows the relationship between the wind turbine power and hub height wind speed. It essentially captures the wind turbine performance. Hence it plays an important role in condition monitoring and control of wind turbines. Power curves made available by the manufacturers help in estimating the wind energy potential in a candidate site. Accurate models of power curve serve as an important tool in wind power forecasting and aid in wind farm expansion. This paper presents an exhaustive overview on the need for modeling of wind turbine power curves and the different methodologies employed for the same. It also reviews in detail the parametric and non-parametric modeling techniques and critically evaluates them. The areas of further research have also been presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
