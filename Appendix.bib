abstract = {The wind turbine power curve shows the relationship between the wind turbine power and hub height wind speed. It essentially captures the wind turbine performance. Hence it plays an important role in condition monitoring and control of wind turbines. Power curves made available by the manufacturers help in estimating the wind energy potential in a candidate site. Accurate models of power curve serve as an important tool in wind power forecasting and aid in wind farm expansion. This paper presents an exhaustive overview on the need for modeling of wind turbine power curves and the different methodologies employed for the same. It also reviews in detail the parametric and non-parametric modeling techniques and critically evaluates them. The areas of further research have also been presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
