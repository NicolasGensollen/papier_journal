abstract = {The power from wind and solar exhibits a nonlinear flickering variability, which typically occurs at time scales of a few seconds. We show that high-frequency monitoring of such renewable powers enables us to detect a transition, controlled by the field size, where the output power qualitatively changes its behaviour from a flickering type to a diffusive stochastic behaviour. We find that the intermittency and strong non-Gaussian behavior in cumulative power of the total field, even for a country-wide installation still survives for both renewable sources. To overcome the short time intermittency, we introduce a time-delayed feedback method for power output of wind farm and solar field that can change further the underlying stochastic process and suppress their strong non- gaussian fluctuations.},

abstract = {In the past, the fundamental graph problem of triangle counting and listing has been studied intensively from a theoretical point of view. Recently, triangle counting has also become a widely used tool in network analysis. Due to the very large size of networks like the Internet, WWW or social networks, the efficiency of algorithms for triangle counting and listing is an important issue. The main intention of this work is to evaluate the practicability of triangle counting and listing in very large graphs with various degree distributions. We give a surprisingly simple enhancement of a well known algorithm that performs best, and makes triangle listing and counting in huge networks feasible. This paper is a condensed presentation of [SW05].},
